  <span class="block">welcome to my home on the internet...ain't my web design skills sick?</span> <br /> <br />
  visuals in portfolios are often redundant. a distraction. although i shoot <a href="https://www.zonerama.com/kikocabala/Album/6870748">analog pics</a>. <br /> <br /> 

  some of the things i did, are public and sharable: <br />
  <div class="things">
    - [slovak] my <a href="https://4b1dden.github.io/covis-2020/">my covid visualisation</a>. got 5000 users here, yay. i just wish more people would be willing to get vaccinated. <br/> 
    - [slovak] looked at some public datasets in an <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iGRS7810mIRR3gqAgxhB4qA1qtiyi2qo?usp=sharing">analysis of public spending</a>. got featured on <a href="http://www.verejne.digital">verejne.digital</a> <br />
    - [english] my paper for physics class on <a href="static/phys_asteroid_paper.pdf">how to deflect an asteroid</a>. nothing too groundbreaking, but i really like typing in LaTeX and it has been a great exercise.

  some of my more "professional" experience:
  <div class="things">
    - [june 2017 - april 2018] junior frontend dev. worked in a team of 5 on developing an internal collaboration platform for "one of the largest financial services providers in Central and Eastern Europe" - <a href="https://www.erstegroup.com/en/home">here</a>. colleagues were amazing and accepted me even though i was sometimes the age of their kids – a pretty good introduction to the world of software engineering. <br />
    - [may 2018 - august 2018] fullstack dev. with a friend of mine we created a solution for a local insurance company. hosted <a href="http://reasured.herokuapp.com/">here</a> (gotta wait until the server wakes up). an interesting experience as we had to sue to get our money; learned a lot programming-wise nonetheless. <br />
    - [march 2019 - august 2019] when i realized that <b class="important">software development is nothing but translating business requirements into react code</b>. medior frontend dev. worked alongside an amazing senior dev on developing the <a href="https://digital-hunter.sk/">digital hunter</a>, a platform to replace slovak national hunters' association internal system. <br />
    - [june 2020 - august 2020] interned at a cryptocurrency trading company. built a high-frequency trading framework from the ground up. later implemented our strategies into the production system too. had an amazing time, definitely want to return here some time in the future :) all of our output, is however private and under a NDA. <br />  
    - [june 2021] will (hopefully) graduate (both) high schools – <a href="https://www.leafacademy.eu/sk/">leaf academy</a> and <a href="https://www.spmndag.sk/">my slovak one</a>
